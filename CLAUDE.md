# Oakdene House Foundation — Website Project

## Project overview
This is the official website for Oakdene House Foundation, a community charity based in Fairfield, Western Sydney. The site supports people and families affected by addiction, hardship, homelessness, and life challenges. The tone is warm, human, practical and non-judgmental. Every design decision should reflect dignity and community.

## Current project: video launch
Adding the Oakdene video (produced by Lead Story) to the homepage and a new watch page at /about/the-oakdene-story/video/. All project material is in docs/video-launch/. Read docs/video-launch/README.md and docs/video-launch/content/issues.md before any video work. docs/ is never published (Astro only publishes src/pages and public).

- Work on the branch feature/oakdene-video and commit after each working step with a clear message
- Never merge to the live branch or deploy without Simon's explicit approval, given as the words "approved to deploy"
- Don't change sections or pages outside the task
- Every build ends with tests and a pass or fail table
- The pack's own CLAUDE.md is kept for reference as docs/video-launch/CLAUDE-pack-original.md. Where it differs from this file (colours in particular), this file wins

### Writing rules for new content
- Australian English (organise, colour, centre, program)
- Plain, direct language. Compassionate, practical and community-centred tone
- Person-first wording: "person in recovery", "people affected by addiction", "lived experience". Never write "addict" in page text, alt text, captions or metadata
- No em dashes in new content. Use a comma or a full stop. Existing pages are not rewritten for this
- Headings are short and say plainly what the section is
- Transcripts and quotes stay word for word, including the reporter's questions
- Video copy uses "29 Vine Street"; the rest of the site keeps "29 Vine St"

## Tech stack
- Framework: Astro 6 — static output only
- Styling: Plain CSS with custom properties — NO Tailwind, NO CSS frameworks
- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages, built from Git (see Build and deploy)
- CMS: Decap CMS planned (for staff content editing via browser), not yet configured
- Forms: Jotform embeds for referral and volunteering. The Contact page form is the one exception (see Forms)
- No database and no server-side rendering. The only server code is the Cloudflare Pages Function in functions/api/contact.js

## Build and deploy
- The live site is published by the Cloudflare Pages project `oakdene-house-website` in Matt Baldwin's Cloudflare account (the account that also holds the oakdenehouse.org.au domain). That project builds from mattmbaldwin/oakdene-house-website, main branch. This repository, Simon-HubEasy/oakdene-house-website, is a fork of it
- To publish: merge work into main here, then open a pull request from Simon-HubEasy:main into mattmbaldwin/oakdene-house-website main. Matt merges it (Simon has no write access there), and Cloudflare publishes automatically within a few minutes. Merging into main here does not change the live site on its own
- A second Pages project, `oakdene-house-website-exk` in Simon's own Cloudflare account, builds this repository and posts preview links on pull requests (oakdene-house-website-exk.pages.dev). It is a test copy only and serves no custom domains. A Pages project can only use the apex domain if it is in the same Cloudflare account as the domain
- Build command: npm run build. Output folder: dist/. Framework preset: Astro. No wrangler.toml and no CI workflow in the repo
- Create Pages projects through Workers & Pages > Create application > Pages (Import an existing Git repository). The default Create flow makes a Worker, which runs `wrangler deploy` and does not run functions/api/contact.js
- public/_redirects holds the 301 redirects for moved pages
- Sitemap: @astrojs/sitemap builds sitemap-index.xml and sitemap-0.xml from every page. Pages left out are listed in SITEMAP_EXCLUDE in astro.config.mjs. Any new noindex, thank-you or error page must be added there
- public/robots.txt allows all crawlers, skips /api/ and names the sitemap. Cloudflare's Bot Preference Sync is on for the zone, so the live file starts with Cloudflare's AI-crawler lines followed by ours
- Analytics: Google Analytics 4 (property G-LGB2GV15KV) is installed through Cloudflare's Google tag gateway, set up in the Cloudflare dashboard on 8 September 2026. The tag is served first-party from /metrics/ and defines window.gtag; there is no GA script in the repo. Do not add GA4 in Zaraz as well: a Zaraz GA4 tool was removed on purpose to stop double-counting. Custom events go through trackEvent() in src/scripts/analytics.ts, which calls gtag and does nothing if it is not loaded. Events: video_play (video_title, video_location) and video_transcript_click (video_location). video_location is homepage, watch_page, story_page (The Oakdene Story page) or resources_page. To report on the parameters, register video_title and video_location as event-scoped custom dimensions in GA4
- Roll back by redeploying the previous production deployment in the Cloudflare dashboard, or by reverting the merge commit on the live branch

## Commands
Node 22.12 or later.
- npm install
- npm run dev (local server at localhost:4321)
- npm run build (outputs to dist/)
- npm run preview (serves dist/)

## Checks
- There are no test, lint or type check scripts. npm run build is the only automated check today
- For each video build, the test step runs ad hoc checks through npx: Lighthouse and @axe-core/cli against the preview server, using the pre-installed Chromium
- Never report a build as done without running npm run build and the build's test step

## Forms
- Jotform embeds: services/referral.astro and community-programs/volunteering/index.astro
- Contact page: posts to /api/contact, a Cloudflare Pages Function (functions/api/contact.js) that checks Cloudflare Turnstile and sends the message by email through Resend
- The Pages Function needs these environment variables in the Cloudflare Pages project (Settings > Variables and secrets): CONTACT_EMAIL_FROM and CONTACT_EMAIL_TO as text, RESEND_API_KEY and TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY as secrets. Locally they go in .dev.vars (see .dev.vars.example, never commit real values)
- Turnstile widget site key: 0x4AAAAAADFd373EZuMIVXX0 (in src/pages/contact.astro). Its Hostnames list must include every address the form runs on: oakdenehouse.org.au and www.oakdenehouse.org.au, plus oakdene-house-website-exk.pages.dev if the test copy's Contact form is used
- Don't build any new form backends. New forms are Jotform embeds

## Design philosophy
This site must feel warm, human and trustworthy — not corporate, not clinical, not generic. Avoid AI-slop aesthetics. Specific rules:
- Use real photography on every page — never default to placeholder divs when real images exist
- Create visual hierarchy with weight and space, not just size
- Use the teal palette with genuine depth — dark sections, light sections, white sections — not just white throughout
- Cards should feel considered, not just boxes with shadows
- Hover states and transitions should be subtle and smooth (0.2s ease)
- Mobile must feel as considered as desktop — not just "responsive"
- Section layouts should vary — not every section is a card grid
- Use the Oakdene tree imagery and brand story on the About pages — it is central to the identity
- Staff photos should be treated with care and dignity
- The "Need Help Now" page should feel calm and reassuring, not alarming

## Brand tokens — use these exact values everywhere
These match the custom properties in src/styles/global.css. Use the variables (var(--color-primary) and so on), not hard-coded values. Don't use the colours in the video pack (#004E60, #003147, #B9D2E9); they are not the site's colours. Social clip bands use #003E51.

- H2: 28–32px, weight 600

## Button styles
- Primary: bg #003E51, text white, hover bg #005A76

## File and folder conventions
- All page files: lowercase with hyphens (e.g. life-choices-program.astro)
- All component files: PascalCase (e.g. ServiceCard.astro)
- Shared client-side scripts: src/scripts/ (TypeScript modules imported by component and page <script> tags)
- All content files: JSON in src/content/. Exception: the video watch page reads video.json and transcript.txt from docs/video-launch/content/ at build time, so the launch pack stays the single source
- Images served from /images/ (files live in public/images/)
- PDFs in public/downloads/
- Never use inline styles — always CSS classes or custom properties
- Never use !important
- Always use semantic HTML (nav, main, section, article, footer, header)
- All images must have descriptive alt text
- All external links open in a new tab with rel="noopener noreferrer"

## Component conventions
- Every page uses BaseLayout.astro
- BaseLayout accepts: title, description (optional), ogImage (optional, defaults to /images/hero/hero-centre-1.jpg), noindex (optional boolean), ogType (optional, defaults to 'website'). It has a named slot "head" for page-specific head content such as JSON-LD (use slot="head" on the element)
- Hero.astro accepts: heading, subheading, image, imageAlt, buttons array of {text, href, variant: 'white' | 'white-outline'}
- CTABand.astro accepts: heading, subheading, primaryBtn {text, href}, secondaryBtn {text, href}, dark boolean (defaults to true)
- ServiceCard.astro accepts: title, summary, href, image, imageAlt, imagePosition, icon, eyebrow (all but the first three optional)
- InfoTable.astro accepts: rows array of {label, value} objects, caption (optional)
- TestimonialBlock.astro accepts: quotes array of {quote, attribution} from testimonials.json
- StatsGrid.astro accepts: stats array of {number, label}
- FAQAccordion.astro accepts: faqs array of {question, answer} from faqs.json
- VideoPlayer.astro accepts: youtubeId, title, thumbnail, label (the play button's screen reader label), loading ('lazy' default, 'eager' above the fold). Loads the youtube-nocookie.com player only when the play button is pressed

## Page structure — current routes
All in src/pages/. URLs use trailing slashes.

- /services/ with subpages: individual-counselling, gambling-counselling, financial-counselling, group-dbt-therapy, life-choices-program, outpatients-program, aa-ga-meetings, referral (Jotform) and referral/thank-you
- /community-programs/ with subpages: oakdene-kitchen, staple-food-packs, oakdene-laundrette, used-clothing-store, ladies-boutique

- accessibility.astro, privacy-policy.astro, terms-of-use.astro
- support-us.astro (noindex, Donate calls to action removed sitewide)

### Moved pages (301 redirects in public/_redirects)
- /forms/ goes to /contact/
- /volunteering/ and its subpages go to /community-programs/volunteering/
- /services/oakdene-kitchen/, staple-food-packs, oakdene-laundrette, used-clothing-store and ladies-boutique go to the matching /community-programs/ page
- When a page moves, add its old URL to public/_redirects

## Things to never do
- Never use Tailwind or any CSS utility framework
- Never add a database or server-side rendering
- Never build a new form backend. New forms are Jotform embeds (the Contact page function is the only exception)
- Never invent organisation details, phone numbers or addresses
- Never use lorem ipsum — always use real Oakdene content
- Never add jQuery
- Never create files outside the established structure without explaining why
- Never use placeholder divs when real images exist in public/images/
- Never reproduce the same card-grid layout on every section

## Jotform links
Live Jotform embeds are on the referral and volunteering pages. For any new form not yet built in Jotform, use href="#form-placeholder" and comment: <!-- TODO: Replace with live Jotform URL -->

## Google Maps
Contact page needs a Google Maps embed for 29 Vine St, Fairfield NSW 2165. Use a placeholder comment: <!-- TODO: Add Google Maps embed code -->

## Decap CMS
Config in public/admin/config.yml. Staff edit via /admin/ in browser.
